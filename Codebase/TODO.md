## Todo
* Basic Necessities from Newer/Community
    - dehardcoded tileset randomization, animation, flowers/grass, etc
    - some utility sprites
        - (improved) magic platform
        - event controllers
* Custom actors
    - port over and polish the ones worth saving from Newer
    - work with synel to port their sprites over?

* Other stuff
    - Koopatlas??? or maybe just Newer's layouts 
    - Level names from the bmg file?
