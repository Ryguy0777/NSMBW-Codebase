KOOPATLAS TODO:
- Rename all members and files and stuff
- Remove any hammer suit hacks
- Convert file indentations to spaces
- Remove all instances of one-line if/for/etc. that don't use braces
- Clean up any ugly-looking code, rename stuff if needed
- Fix Koopatlas class naming scheme to match official (dKP -> dKp)
- Maybe make base Koopatlas actor for everything to inherit from (stop execution when needed, other general stuff)
- Move constants to `koopatlas_constants.h` (only stuff that users may wish to modify)

Nitpicky Shit:
- Player is not centered on the course node, needs to be moved up 4 units like with the model itself
- Same as above, but for the pointlight effect
- Course open sound plays even when no actual course is opened (only if its on another map)

Miscellaneous TODO:
- Implement internal-font portion of MoreFonts, then use that for Newer's pause menu layout
- Add support for overiding the BMG font via userdata
- Move pane_userdata hacks to whatever the right place is
- Revamp Star Coins Menu arrows to have idle animations and look more like the retail arrow layouts
- Add succession scrolling to the Star Coins Menu
- Add sparkles to the HUD stars
- Focus circle wipes on the player position

Bugs:
- [Newer bug] Exiting from a "cave entrance" will scale the player incorrectly, they're slightly too small
- Make it so the player can't reverse on a path after going through a map change node
  - This fixes the disaster that happens when entering a course after doing this, where the paths completely break

Planned Features/TODO:
- Add support for "back entrances" where a course will auto-begin when walking onto the node
- Support for P1 being other characters (maybe make this part of P1 Change define)
- Subplayer support (maybe)
- Map View (togglable)
- World Select (rsm's, not retail)
- Retail styled HUD (maybe, togglable)
- CLR anims for Course Nodes
- Start Nodes (implement same way as the improved level nodes)
- Freeze map when displaying a warning screen
- Make player shrink when opening a menu
- Togglable option for level nodes to not render (specifically to de-hardcode that one node in the W1 map)
- Dehardcoded effect/model positions (maybe)
- Make map background based on the W2 quicksand
- Allow Koopatlas layouts to be used in the retail World Maps
  - HUD still needs to be finished
- Add interactable signposts (maybe)
